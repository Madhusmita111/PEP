#  PEP – DSA Topic Tracker

This repository documents my **topic-wise Data Structures & Algorithms practice** covered during **PEP placement preparation classes**.  
It acts as a structured learning log, revision notebook, and interview preparation tracker.

All solutions are implemented in **C++** with focus on fundamentals, clarity, and optimal thinking.
