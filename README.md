#  PEP – DSA Topic Tracker

This repository documents my **topic-wise Data Structures & Algorithms practice** covered during **PEP placement preparation classes**.  
It acts as a structured learning log, revision notebook, and interview preparation tracker.

All solutions are implemented in **C++** with focus on fundamentals, clarity, and optimal thinking.

## Daily Progress Log

*(Updated regularly after PEP sessions)*

---

## Practice Sources

Problems are inspired from:

- LeetCode  
- Geeksforgeeks
- Codeforces   
- Instructor assignments  

(Links may be added gradually for reference.)

---

## Objectives

- Maintain structured topic-wise learning  
- Reinforce PEP classroom training  
- Build strong DSA fundamentals  
- Enable fast revision before placements  
- Develop interview-ready thinking

---

## Language Used

- **C++** (STL used where appropriate)

---

## Update Policy

Repository is updated after:

- Each PEP class  
- Daily practice sessions  
- Revision days  

Consistency is prioritized over volume.

---

## Notes

- Solutions prioritize clarity over shortcuts  
- Code is written for learning and interview revision  
- Multiple approaches may exist for some problems  
- Folder structure grows with class progression
